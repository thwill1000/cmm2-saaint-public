"Welcome to THE GREAT BLACKBERRY ADVENTURE.
"
"Your mother is in the kitchen making pastry."
"You're lying on your bed reading when she yells out and asks you to fetch some blackberries for the pie."
"It's closed."
"A rabbit is startled and runs into the bushes."
"The trees are swaying in the wind overhead."
"I think I see blackberries on the other side of the gully."
"I hear a rustling sound coming from the bushes."
"The spray is cold, it smells horrible."
"The cream is soothing. That feels better."
"My arms are getting a little sore."
"The blackberries are plump and juicy, yum."
"Something is making the bushes move."
"OK."
"I see an article titled..."
"I think I can see a dark shape in the undergrowth."
"The batteries are flat, it's light enought to see anyway."
"There's chiggers in there. They've bitten me!"
"Chiggers jump on me then jump off. They don't like the spray."
"The blackberry thorns scratch my arms."
"My arms are very itchy."
"A bird is singing in the trees above."
"I have nothing to carry them in."
"It looks good on you."
"Time passes..."
"It's too steep to climb, maybe too wide to jump."
"You hit the other side and fall, hitting your head."
"My head hurts, I need to sleep."
"The log neatly bridges the gap across the gully."
"---"
"You mother says 'We came looking for you when you were late.'"
"As you step off the log it shifts a little and falls into the gully below."
"My arms are hurting, I think they're getting infected."
"I feel faint."
"Need to lie down."
"'Ah, thank you' your mother says 'now drop them and say SCORE'."
"It does no good for chigger bites."
"Is that a blackberry bush?"
"A bird in a tree is hopping from branch to branch."
"The ladder is too short! It drops into the gully below."
"It's been crushed flat."
"NO! you don't have any scratches."
"It's a red Swiss Army Knife with many different blades"
"It's an old fashioned torch with a globe."
"The label says it repels 99% of all insects."
"A tube of cream for soothing itches and scratches."
"A woven cane basket."
"Boring. There's a nice one of me though."
"A nice pink cake of soap, no use to me."
"Just the usual ones. Not your favorites."
"It's a fairly long log, a bit charred on one end."
"Just an ordinary small ladder."
"There is a clear liquid in the bottle. Maybe it's water?"
"Your favorites."
"Nothing to see here. Move along."
"Somebody has lit a camp fire here, but it's cold now."
"Better not, your mother is watching."
"'Good afternoon sleepyhead' your mother says."
"
'Please go and get me those blackberries'."
"'Sorry, I'm too busy now'."
"It's your favorite jacket, in the team colours."
"
'The doctor said you'll be fine in a couple of days'
"
"
'CHIGGER NUMBERS INCREASING.'"
"
'Authorities advise the public to use protection when...'"
"The rest is covered by flour."
"I don't think you'll need that."
"That's not very interesting."
"Your mother is using it."
"There's nothing of interest in there."
"She's busy making pastry."
"Manners please, say 'hello' first."
"It's pretty heavy but I can manage it."
"You're not allowed to take that away."
"It's open."
"Lying on the ground."
"You didn't notice that before?"
"YES! That's what you're after."
"Sorry, but carrying BOTH the log AND the ladder will be too much for me."
"That's none of your business."
"The bushes close behind you, blocking your way."
"Jackets aren't made for carrying."
"Your jacket protected you from the thorns, stylish AND functional. Well done!"
"It's a bit overgrown but I can get through."
"I can't pick up the log now, it's too difficult."
"
