ChangeLog
---------

Version 2.0.4 - ??-???-2021:
  - Fixed bug that caused "Ghost Town" to describe initial location twice.
  - Fixed bug with handling of "dark flag":
    - was incorrectly being maintained separately from bit 15 of the status
      flags with which it is supposed to be synonymous. This is probably only
      significant for later adventures that make more use of the status flags.
  - Added *OBJECTS meta-command:
    - prints the id, current location and name of every object in the adventure.
    - WARNING! may contain spoilers.
  - Added *VOCAB meta-command:
    - prints the adventure's verb and noun tables.
      - the tables usually only contain the first 3-5 significant characters
        of each word.
      - an entry preceded by a + is a synonym for the previous entry.
    - the noun table does not necessarily contain the nouns for all the
      adventure's objects, see the output of *OBJECTS.
    - WARNING! may contain spoilers.

Version 2.0.3 - 20-Jul-2021:
 - Added support for unencrypted walkthough (.wlk) files.
   These are in the same format as ordinary script files but should be put in
   the directory containing the corresponding "<adventure>.dat" and be named
   "<adventure>.wlk".
 - Changed location of "saaint.ini" file from "<saaint-root>/src"
   to "<saaint-root>". If the .ini file is not present in "<saaint-root>" but
   is present in "<saaint-root>/src" then it will be moved.
 - Changed location of temporary files from "<saaint-root>/src"
   to "<saaint-root>/tmp".

Version 2.0.2 - 17-Jul-2021:
 - Added "seed" key to "saaint.ini". If the value is > 0 then the random number
   generator will be seeded with this value when an adventure is started or
   restored. Otherwise the random number generator is seeded from the TIMER.

Version 2.0.1 - 19-Jun-2021:
 - Changed password input typed by user (to access walkthroughs) from
   green text to white text to match other user input.
 - Fixed 'dump.bas' utility which was missing a #Include statement.

Version 2.0.0 - 8-Jun-2021:
 - Substantially enhanced standalone version including *with permission*
   Scott Adams' Classic Adventures #1-#12.
 - Should also be capable of playing Brian Howarth's "Mysterious Adventures"
   and other adventures in TRS-80 / ScottFree / .dat file format.
 - The author has only used SAAINT to play Scott Adams's Classic Adventures
   #1-#3 to completion, the others *should work*, let me know if they do not.
 - For firmware 5.07.00 or later.

Version 1.0.0 - 24-Jan-2021:
 - Original version distributed with version 1.0.0 of "The Welcome Tape".
 - Only capable of playing the BYTE Magazine version of "Pirate Adventure".
